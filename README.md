# Closed On Monday Gallery
[Closed On Monday](http://closedonmondaygallery.com/) is a virtual, interactive 3d gallery which runs monthly exhibitions. An experimental take on the Artist Run Initiative, COM Gallery features work from emerging artists based in Sydney, Australia. The site also contains an archive, allowing users to revisit previous COM exhibitions.

# Technology
Closed On Monday is realised with THREE.js, the Web Audio API, and Collider - a simple physics library. We work with artists one-on-one to extend their work into the third dimension, often employing custom GLSL to bring the presentations to life.
