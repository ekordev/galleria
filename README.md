# Closed On Monday Gallery
[Closed On Monday](http://closedonmondaygallery.com/) is a virtual, interactive 3d gallery which runs monthly exhibitions. An experimental take on the Artist Run Initiative, COM Gallery features work from emerging artists based in Sydney, Australia. The site also contains an archive, allowing users to revisit previous COM exhibitions.

# Technology
Closed On Monday is realised with THREE.js, the Web Audio API, and Collider - a simple physics library. We work with artists on a per-exhibition basis to extend their work into the third dimension, and often employ custom GLSL scripts to bring the presentations to life.
